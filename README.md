# MyCalendar

This daily calendar lets you save an event, as well as fills the current time with a certain color, and the past and future with their own colors.

# Goal

This project helped me explore the benefits of using bootstrap and mixing it with javascript to make a useful application. the main goal was to edit the source code and add the function of local storage saving, as well as color coding the current time. The current day dsiplasys at the top of the screen using moment.js
